# WhatsApp Cloud API
Individual developers and Business Service Providers (BSPs) can now send and receive messages using a cloud-hosted version of the WhatsApp Business Platform API. Compared to the previous solutions, Cloud API is simpler to use and is a more cost-effective way for businesses to use WhatsApp.

## Prerequisites
The WhatsApp Cloud API and WhatsApp Business Management API are part of Metaâ€™s Graph API, so you need to set up a Meta developer account and a Meta developer app. To set that up:

Register as a Meta Developer 
Enable two-factor authentication for your account 
Create a Meta App: Go to developers.facebook.com > My Apps > Create App. Select the "Business" type and follow the prompts on your screen.

## Supported Operations

1. Send a Test Message
2. Receive a Test Message
3. Get a phone number ID
4. Register Phone Number
5. Upload Image
6. Send sticker
7. Download Media Content

I plan to try these operations first before moving on to the further actions.
